# Collision-avoidance-robot
Collision avoidance robot while tracking obstacles in the path and temperature of nearby objects and recalibrate the new path.

Collision Avoiding Robot with Temperature Detection It is an intelligent device that can automatically sense the obstacle in front of it and avoid them by turning itself in another direction. This design allows the robot to navigate in an unknown environment by avoiding collisions, which is a primary requirement for any autonomous mobile robot. Here an Ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the obstacles in the path by calculating the distance between the robot and obstacle. If robot finds any obstacle it changes the direction and continues moving Here temperature sensor measures the temperature around the obstacles that the robot detects
